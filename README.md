# SALES AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The projectâ€™s main goal is to implement a sales and inventory management system for a Restaurant that will improve efficiency and overall lessen lead time as well as give accurate reports on the status of inventory stocks and sales, to complete these this study specifically aims to:

1. To reduce and possibly eliminate the likelihood of errors in taking orders, recording transactions, as well as managing inventory by overhauling the current manual and paper-based system the Restaurant has by implementing and utilizing  a POS or point of sale system terminal which can act as a cash drawer that syncs transactions with the inventory control software as well as an automated inventory system.

2. To set up encryption keys and give special users access to different information to solidify the security of keeping important information from being breached by any unwanted personnel. Sensitive information may only be accessed by authorized admins, and updating information on the database where information is kept will be accessible by the employees through transactions.

3. To implement automated sales and inventory management complete with inventory restocking suggestions as well as notifications of different errors within the system to compensate for the lack of information backups. The system will provide recovery files if records are lost or corrupted by keeping multiple copies within the database.

4. To implement a database that can transmit Information through a sales and inventory management system allowing said information to flow very rapidly and consistently, allowing decision-makers to be more precise and reliant because of the information they have.

5. To provide a minimal lead time for transactions and operations when maintaining the restaurant. This can be done through automated calculations done by the system and can also auto generate reports for stock levels which will cut down on the time needed to process data.
